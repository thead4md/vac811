> **IMPORTANT: Read [CONTEXT.md](CONTEXT.md) before doing anything in this project.**

CONTEXT.md is auto-generated on every push and contains the authoritative, up-to-date
snapshot of this codebase. Always read it first so you understand:

- Current architecture and module map
- Active TODOs and known constraints
- Tech stack, key dependencies, and environment variables
- Recent changes (last 10 commits)

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests
npm test

# Run the application
npm run dev
```

---

## Project-Specific Constraints

<!-- Add permanent constraints, invariants, or non-obvious rules here.
     This section is NOT auto-generated and will not be overwritten.

     Examples:
     - Safety invariants (e.g., "dry-run by default — never mutate without --confirm")
     - Frozen thresholds (e.g., "confidence threshold is 0.85 — do not change without data")
     - External dependencies (e.g., "requires Gmail OAuth credentials in .env")
     - Code style decisions (e.g., "no type stubs for internal modules")
-->

## How CONTEXT.md is Updated

- On every push to `main`/`master`
- On every pull request
- Daily at 03:00 UTC

To regenerate manually:
